📢 About
# Do You Belong?

An Interactive fiction

Build a rebellion against Big Brother with your mask of morality!

As the ordinance officer for Big Brother, he secretly despises his reign. You will build a rebellion with your Mask of Morality, which you distribute to your fellow patrons. Approve or deny the loyalists and the Rebels.

Like “Papers Please,” but we approve or deny who will bring freedom to your Orwell-inspired dystopia.

Help or Destroy a Faceless Society
# Rules:
-  Listen to the Pleas and Praise of the faceless society
- Determine if society will remain loyal to Big Brother or rebel to overthrow him!
- Select with the left mouse button (LMB)
- Build Moral to Overthrow or Become Obedient to Big Brother!
-  Be wary with your words, for Big Brother is always watching!


What wrath will his gaze unleash?!

You don't want to know...

Do you belong to this society, or will this society belong to you?
